# JoJo the Virtual Assistant

Created this virtual assistant that does some simple 
tasks for now, I plan to include more features to it
soon, but for now it can: 
* Tell Time
* Tell Weather in Santa Isabel (soon will upgrade for region of computer)
* Tell you a joke (they are usually very bad lol)
* Play a song in yourube (or any youtube video for that matter)
* look people in wikipidea
* look things in wikipidea

The codewords to carry these tasks are writen in the if statements of the ```run_jojo()``` fucntion.
